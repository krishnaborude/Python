# Python Learning Repository üêç

This repository contains comprehensive Python learning materials, examples, and practice exercises covering various fundamental and advanced Python concepts.

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Four Pillars of OOP:
  - **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity (e.g., Payment System)
  - **Encapsulation**: Data hiding (e.g., Bank Account)
  - **Inheritance**: Reusing parent class properties (e.g., Animal -> Dog)
  - **Polymorphism**: Same interface, different implementations (e.g., Shape.area())

### 2. File Handling
- Basic file operations (read, write, append)
- Working with different file formats:
  - Text files (.txt)
  - JSON files
  - Pickle files
- File methods:
  - read(), write(), append()
  - seek() and tell()
  - readlines()
- File management:
  - Checking file existence
  - Copying files
  - Removing files

### 3. Exception Handling
- Try-except blocks
- Multiple exception handling
- Common exceptions:
  - FileNotFoundError
  - ZeroDivisionError
  - NameError
- Built-in exceptions

### 4. Generators
- Basic generator functions with yield
- Generator expressions
- Examples:
  - Square number generator
  - Fibonacci sequence generator
- Memory efficient iteration

### 5. Iterables and Iterators
- Understanding iteration protocols
- Working with iterables:
  - Lists
  - Dictionaries
  - Strings
- Iterator methods
- Custom iterators
- Tasks and examples for practice

### 6. Decorators
- Function decorators
- Class decorators
- Real-world usage examples
- Decorator syntax and patterns

## üìù Practice Examples and Tasks

1. **File Handling Tasks**:
   - Create and manage student records
   - Count lines, words, and characters in files
   - File copying and manipulation
   - Working with different file formats

2. **Python Exercises**:
   - Character index mapping
   - Recursive functions (e.g., factorial)
   - Running sum calculations
   - String manipulations

## üíª How to Use

1. Each topic has its own directory with:
   - Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) containing examples and explanations
   - Practice exercises and solutions
   - Related Python scripts

2. Jupyter notebooks are organized with:
   - Markdown explanations
   - Code examples
   - Practice exercises
   - Output demonstrations

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.10.11 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- Required Python packages:
  - json
  - pickle
  - os

## üìñ Learning Path

1. Start with basic Python concepts in the OOP section
2. Move on to file handling for data persistence
3. Learn exception handling for robust code
4. Explore advanced concepts like generators and decorators
5. Practice with the exercises in each section

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Complete all practice exercises
- Create your own examples
- Implement real-world projects using these concepts
- Explore advanced Python topics

Happy Learning! üéâ
